### What is Myers Briggs Personality Prediction?
The MBTI test was developed to help people understand personality traits in a wider range of people. The MBTI test can help people understand their strengths, limitations, and potential differences from others, even if there is no such thing as "better" or "worse" personality preferences.
### Types of MBTI Indicators
1. Extraversion (E) – Introversion (I)
2. Sensing (S) – Intuition (N)
3. Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)
4. Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)

On these bases, there are 16 types: ISTJ, ISTP, ISFJ, ISFP, INFJ, INFP, INTJ, INTP, ESTP, ESTJ, ESFP, ESFJ, ENFP, ENFJ, ENTP, ENTJ.

We will try to predict from test data personalitites out of these 16 types.
